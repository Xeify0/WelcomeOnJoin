# Welcome On Join
Built for 1.8-1.20. This plugin is very simple.

## Installation

You can build it using modules, but typically I prefer and use mvn install, and build the jar that way.
You must have Lombok installed.

```bash
mvn install
```

## Usage

```bash
/welcome - /welcome <linenumber> <message> (SUPPORTS COLOR CODES!)
/read - sends you the welcome message
```
